<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Alexander Stepanovich Green. Quiet
everyday life</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>I</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Eugenia Alekseevna Mazalevskaya came to
visit her relatives in the village for the summer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>relatives.  They were her uncle and aunt
by her husband, his wife.  The girl's mother</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>died when her daughter was six years
old; her father, the headmaster of a gymnasium, lived in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>St. Petersburg, alone.  He was a man of
acrimony and cruelty, intolerant of other people's opinions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a strange combination of bureaucrat and
liberal. In</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>towards his daughter he was a true
Dombey, though his Slavic blood prevented him</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from holding up that label.  There's no
doubt that he loved the girl as much as she loved him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>as she loved him, but on his part the
love was irritable and despotic,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>demanding submission to his views; on
hers, simple, but reserved and proud,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for the old man never spoke plainly, but
only in intricate,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>rebus-like hints, and could drive any
one into a frenzy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>by sudden turns from stingy gentleness
to gratuitous, or at least unexplained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>or at least unexplained bitterness.  It
was a hard, hurtful relationship for a young</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>relationship. The cause of it lay, of
course, in the father's character, but the cause</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>this, as well as his inner life, was a
secret to Eugenia.  She was constantly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>drawn to relations simple and cordial,
but many of the experiences of life</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>had so developed that, having lost the
clear directness of her soul, she had become</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>withdrawn and fearful, inwardly silent,
like a man startled by a sudden</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and went through life with a sad
distrust of her,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>trying to keep out of the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Of course, this pale city girl was
glad to get away for a time</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from her difficult relations with her
father, from her service (she served in the office of the medical</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>journal), and, smiling at the pleasures
of summer, went to her uncle, whom she had</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>whom she had seen once in her life.  The
uncle, a landowner, suffering from constant failures in the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>cultivation of corn, peaches, Argentine
cucumbers, and other things ruinous</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for a northern pocket, looked
absentmindedly at his niece over his glasses</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>with the naive eyes of a benighted
nobleman, thrust agricultural pamphlets into her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>agricultural pamphlets, told her about
strawberries, and in the mornings, with a newspaper</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>in his hands, rubbing his forehead
assiduously, he would knock at Eugenia's door. “Look here,” said</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“Look here,” he would say, “a most
marvelous report: it appears that in the Egyptian</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>sphinx these devils, what are their 
Belgians ...  have opened a temple. What a marvel.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Seeing the man, he suffered, wrinkled
his nose and said “you,” to which the man respectfully</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>objected: “So you, father, Pal Palych,
you'll have to peel off the vygonu, without that, where's the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>without this?”  The manager, aka the
headman of the village church, stole as he wished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Pavel Pavlovich played the piano
beautifully; while he was playing, his face became</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and energetic.  He did not like towns;
he had served formerly in the electoral service, but had</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>but gave it up, saying, “What can you do
with them - they'll turn as they like.” His wife, Inna</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Sergeyevna, a languid, sickly,
lemon-colored face, a loose lady, could</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>could spend hours reminiscing about St.
Petersburg.   The spouses sometimes quarreled, whispering, without</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>without passion, with an annoying
boredom in their hearts.  Inna Sergeyevna would say, sighing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to her husband:  “Pasha, I have given
you everything, everything,-you are a narrow, ungrateful man,” -</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to which, wiping his sweating
spectacles, Pavel Pavlovich replied: “He who remembers the old</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>reminisce, he shall be put out of his
sight.”  The guests, fearing boredom, went to see them rarely and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>reluctantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Evgenia Alexeevna spent her time in
walking, reading, thinking, sleeping, and eating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>eating. In two weeks she became
noticeably better, pinker, in the eyes appeared</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a healthy sparkle in her eyes.  The lazy
quiet of summer strengthened her.  At the same time in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a provincial town in a neighboring
province.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>II</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>  A young man Stepan Sotkin, a burgher,
after a long absence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>returned home.  He had served for three
years, wherever and however he could, in various places in Russia: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>as a cashier on a steamship, as a
weighmaster at a station, as a conductor and agent</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Russia: cashier on a steamship, weigher
at a station, conductor, and agent</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for a linen firm.  He had not
corresponded with his parents for nearly a year, so that, on his</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>return, it was a great and serious news
to him to hear of the death</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of his older brother's death, so Stepan
Sotkin had to draw lots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>There were not many conscripts this
year; the favorable lot demanded happiness</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>exceptional, and they couldn't reject
Sotkin, because he was a man</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>healthy, tall and fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     In the evening there was a family
tea party in the garden under an elderberry tree.  Old Sotkin,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a widower and keeper of the state
chamber, said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - “They'll take you away, Stepan.
Grisha will die, and you'll get a forehead. I'll stay with Petyka.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - It is not yet known, - Stepan
answered.  - I, in fact, have no desire</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I have no desire for military service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     After four years of wandering he
thought of the soldier's burden with hatred and disgust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>disgust.  From the age of 16, Sotkin got
used to living quite independently,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>moving from town to town, spending his
strength, labor and money as he wished. He</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>remembered the lively, colorful Moscow,
the blue Volga, the hum of the fair in Nizhny,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the disorderly music of the port of
Odessa; in front of him, shrouded in the smoke of the locomotive,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>ran the forest. And Sotkin shook his
head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Yes, I don't feel like it,” he
repeated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - You can't jump higher than your
ears,” said the old man. - Shall we run away? To England.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Two years and eight months - you'll get
over it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin sighed and went out for a
wander and went into a pub.  There, clutching his head</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>with his hands, he sat drinking bottles
until closing time and, having thoroughly discussed the situation,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>he decided that he had to serve.  Life
abroad beckoned him, but it also frightened him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>by the impossibility of returning to
Russia.  “To serve is to serve,” he said,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>tossing breadcrumbs into his mouth,
“that's how it will be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     He was assigned to Penza.  The
usual bewilderment and confusion of recruits</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>before the new conditions of life (most
of them “gray” country boys), as well as</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>as well as their naive vanity, satisfied
by the new red epaulettes,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the crack of the drum and the music,
were alien to Sotkin.  As a man of experience and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>developed, he quickly learned all the
simple wisdom of stepping and unsticking</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>socks, dressing up, eating his superiors
with his eyes, the rifle mechanism, and -</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the so-called “diction.”  Sotkin's
smooth, calm character helped him</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>avoid sharp confrontations with
non-commissioned officers and “old soldiers”, who lorded it over the newcomers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the new recruits.  He did not try to get
promoted, but he was executed.  None of this</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>interfered with Sotkin's immediate
superiors - subplatoon, platoon, fieldfebel</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and the corporal (who usually played the
part of Iago among the non-commissioned officers; the warm,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the captenarmus's warm, economic
position - a subject of envy - makes him a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>gossip, intriguer, and diplomatist) to
treat the young soldier coldly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and disapproving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     There is a breed of man to whom
Goldsmith's words may, modifyingly, be referred:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“I am quite sure that no expressions of
submission will restore me to freedom even</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for one hour.”  Sotkin might have said,
“No amount of effort to be a model</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“will not win me the favor of the
non-commissioned officers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin was one of those men who
have the unfortunate</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>ability, when in dependence, to cause,
without any care for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>it, a deafening unreasonable enmity on
the part of those on whom they depended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>There were no provinces of service or
discipline behind him, but his internal</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>attitude toward the service, quite
mechanical and indifferent, the inability to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to ingratiate, to flatter, to flatter,
to bend and to flutter, was expressed,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>probably quite unconsciously, in
trifles: an occasional, staring or</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>quick glance, a smile, a smile, a tone
of voice, silence to the sharpness of the nonce, calm</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>answers, quick movements.  He cleaned
the fieldfebel's boots without wrinkling his nose, but</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>only when ordered to do so; others,
rising early, worked with an incomprehensible voluptuousness of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>with an incomprehensible
voluptuousness.  He, besides all this, drank every day tea with</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>with white bread, and did not owe the
marquis.  The soldiers respected him, and the petty authorities,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>coldly gleaming eyes, looked at Sotkin
with the vague, indifferent look</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>with the vague indifferent look of a cat
contemplating the sparrows in the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Such a relationship, of course, sooner
or later, was bound to be strained and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and come to light.  The camp meeting
came.  Beyond the Sura were the white tents of the O battalion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>green alleys, the tents of the O
battalion.  The soldiers, returning from a drill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>shooting, boasting to each other about
their aim, dreaming of prize-winning</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>hours.  Sotkin, shooting poorly, rarely
penetrated a target with more than two bullets</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>out of five.  The first shout of the
field officer: “Sotkin, look!” - and the second: “Crow, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>still in the first company!” made him
aim more carefully and longer; however,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>more than three bullets waved did not
show him the red badge. In a month's time</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>we switched to movable targets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     On a horizontal revolving pole, at
three hundred paces, slowly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>appearing from the trench and
disappearing, jumped out of the waist figures. The platoon fired</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>lying down.  The suffocating, fiery heat
streamed over the field in colorless shimmers of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>air, the front sight and the sighting
frame glistened in the sun, beaming as the flame of a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of a candle to a man squinting at it. 
Aiming was difficult.  In the distance,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>at eye level, dived, the size of a
playing card, two-arch belted targets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>targets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin, holding his breath, took
aim and let the target disappear so that he could shoot the next time it
appeared,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>so that he could shoot the next time it
appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The target reappeared.  Sotkin
fired, the bullet, kicking up dust far away,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>sang and was gone. He wasted the other
four cartridges, he didn't hit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Under the satchel, - said the
company officer. Sotkin blushed thickly and frowned. He</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>had to serve a sentence for the first
time.  Chagrin and unreasonable shame</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>took possession of him, as if he had
really done something to stain himself in the eyes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of others, but he soon realized that he
was only ashamed because he would have to stand</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>in full marching gear for two hours, and
everybody would look on and at least smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and smile at least mentally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The company, having finished
firing, with the young men's songs about “Major-General Alkhaz” and “the
spinning blue balloon”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and “spinning blue ball”, returned to
camp. Sotkin was searched for by the platoon leader.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Sotkin,” he said indifferently,
biting his lip, ”get dressed and go to the line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The soldier, having listened to the
order, returned to his tent, hung on himself everything</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>on himself - a manikin, cartridges, a
rolled-up overcoat, a bag,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>took his rifle and went out, ready to
fall through the ground. Red as a peony,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Sotkin looked into the cold face of the
non-commissioner with almost pleading eyes.  Unter,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>having examined the equipment, took
Sotkin to the middle of the line and placed him facing the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the camp....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - That's right, - he said and
looked at his watch, and then left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin took “on his shoulder.”  The
soldiers, as they passed him, cast oblique</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>glances - it was so strange to see
Sotkin under the satchel.  He, pouring</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>sweat, he suffered patiently and
steadfastly; the sun was burning intolerably, scorching the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the back of his head, and from the heat
a nervous chill ran through his body, aching from the weight and unnatural
position of his arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a nervous chill ran through the body. 
The gray-haired field-febel, smiling in his moustache, approached Sotkin,
openly and caressingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Sotkin, looked openly and affectionately
into his eyes and said just as affectionately:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Closer socks. Elbow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Two hours passed.  Sotkin was
released, he came into the tent and for a long time, pretending to be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>pretending to look for something,
rummaged through the trunk, avoiding talking to his comrades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>His embarrassment passed only by
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     A day later there was shooting
again, but this time - accidentally or not - Sotkin hit five out of four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Sotkin hit four out of five. The soldier
breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - You'll get into the first
category, - monotonously told him, passing in the chain,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the platoon commander said to him
monotonously, “you'll get a watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     He was laughing, of course. Sotkin
understood it that way, but only waved his hand,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>thinking: “A dog barks, the wind carries
it.”  Their eyes met for one sly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>mute instant, and it became clear to
Sotkin that the noncommissioned officer would definitely and cruelly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>hate him for whatever he had done, bad
or good, all the same, for</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for being Sotkin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Several days passed.  The platoon
was cleaning their rifles.  The rag that was wrapped around</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the end of the ramrod, long ago came out
of the muzzle clean as washed, and Sotkin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>began to reassemble the disassembled
rifle.  A sergeant, watching the work,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>came up to Sotkin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Let me see.  - He brought the
muzzle to his eyes, turned the other end of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the other end of the barrel to the sun,
looked for a long time, saw that it was cleaned perfectly, and therefore</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>he said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>- Three. Wipe some more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - There's nothing there, - Sotkin
objected, showing wiping rags, - here,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>take a look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - If I say...  - began the
sergeant, trying to find an expressive,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>long phrase, but he stammered. - Clean
it, clean it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin wiggled the ramrod in the
muzzle for about ten minutes, but he could already feel a voice of resistance</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the voice of resistance rising in his
soul.   This day was for him</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>exceptionally unpleasant because in the
morning he had lost money, eight</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>rubles, and in the evening a
circumstance occurred that was unexpected and violent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Some thirty soldiers, having
supped, had gathered in a circle, and, under the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>under the direction of the fieldfebel
who had organized the entertainment, they sang one after another</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>one after another. Sotkin stood there
listening. He had neither hearing nor</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>voice, so, not taking part in the
chorus, he confined himself to the role of a man</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of the audience.  A hot-headed, hoarse
field-felon, without a hat, in a pink</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>chintz shirt, stretching his arms over
the crowd, threatened the tenors furiously,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>bulging basses, and extinguishing the
so-called “woman's voices,” the possessors of which were in all cases tall men</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>were in all cases tall men. It got dark,
and the lights of the city glittered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Sotkin, sing,” said the
field-felon, when the song was over.  - You don't</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>know how, eh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - That's right, I can't. - Sotkin
smiled, thinking that the lieutenant was joking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - You've never sung?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Never.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Wait.  - The lieutenant came out
of the circle and approached the soldier closely,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and scrutinized him from head to toe.  -
Learn.  “Do-re-mi-fa...”  Well,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>repeat it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I don't know how, - said Sotkin and
suddenly, noticing that the small eyes of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of the lieutenant's small eyes were
fixed on him, and he became wary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Well, sing,” he repeated
languidly, half-closing his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin was silent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - You do not want to, - said the
fieldfebel, - I know, you suprotective. Execute</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin turned pale; at the same
moment the fieldfelon also turned pale, and both of them</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>looked into each other's eyes and sighed
deeply. “Well, it won't do</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for you,” thought the soldier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Do as you're told.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - No, I can't, Mr. Fieldfebel,”
said Sotkin, separately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and, after a moment's thought, added: -
Forgive me generously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     A joyful, cheerful smile lit up the
wrinkles of the brave servant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Ah, Sotkin, Sotkin,” he said,
sighing, shook his head sadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and, folding his hands on his prominent
belly, looked around cheerfully. The soldiers, having stopped singing,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>looked at them. - Come with me,” he said
dryly, no longer smiling, squinted his</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>his eyes and walked towards the town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Excited, but not realizing what was
wrong, Sotkin walked beside him. Behind</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>behind his back the chorus rang out. 
Not far from the camp stretched an old trench, densely</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>overgrown with briars and nettles; in
these bushes the field-felder stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - They used to teach us like this,”
he said, businesslike and unhurried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>hitting Sotkin's face with all his
might; he did it not with his fist, but with the palm of his hand,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>so as not to leave any marks.  Sotkin's
head whipped from side to side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Stunned, he instinctively covered
himself with his hand.  The lieutenant, turning the soldier abruptly by the
shoulders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the soldier by the shoulders, poked him
in the neck with his fist, laughed and calmly walked away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin stood motionless, almost
unable to believe it had happened. Both his cheeks</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>burned with pain, his ears were ringing,
and it hurt to move his head. He picked up</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the fallen cap, put it on, and looked
toward the camp.  The soldiers were singing “Oy, za</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>gaem, gaem...&quot;; in the lighted
doorway of the maritain's shop could be seen the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of non-commissioned officers drinking
tea. The tents were vaguely white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - And you can't beat me,” said
Sotkin aloud, turning to this peaceful</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>picture of military life.  - I have not
been beaten by the ears for a long time,” he went on, ”I will not</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>allow it, as you want me to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     He sat for five minutes on the
ground, swallowing his tears and remembering the nasty</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>touch of the fist, then crept into the
tent, covered himself with his overcoat without undressing,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>with his overcoat and began to think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>There were two years of service ahead. 
During that time there could be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>many more occasions for the superiors'
temper, and Sotkin, a man who did not like to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to bear insults submissively, could, at
last, burst into a temper of his own,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>which usually led to worse things.  He
knew from stories the history of some</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of some soldiers who had been hounded
into hard labor, it happened in this sequence:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>light and dark punishment cell,
punishment cell by trial, disciplinary battalion, shackles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>But it was hard to expect a change of
wind.  Memories told Sotkin that the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>superiors, interrupting with the shout,
“Hey you, professor of sour sorrels, compiler of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to prayer!” - some trifling story to the
soldiers about the Eiffel Tower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“uses his power, not only for business
purposes, but because it is power,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>because it is power, a thing pleasant in
itself, which is even more pleasant to use</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>aimlessly on a man of mental strength. 
There was a great</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>room for everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     “I could ruin my life here, for
that's what it's worth,” thought Sotkin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Finally, having made a firm decision not
to serve any longer, he fell asleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     A day later, Sotkin was not at roll
call in the morning.  The field officer</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>wrote a report, the company officer
wrote to the regimental officer, the regimental officer to the district; a
little more</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of ink had been expended in correcting
the ration sheets, and the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>city and county police stations noted,
scratching their backs, in the lists of other</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>fugitives and wandering people, the
burgher Stepan Sotkin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>III</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I like ruffs very much,” said
Pavel Pavlovich, motioning the plate to his wife,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>- but there's not enough pepper in the
ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     There were four diners - an uncle,
an aunt, Evgenia Alekseevna, and an old acquaintance of Inna Sergeyevna's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Apollon Cheprakov, an old acquaintance
of Inna Sergeyevna's, whom she had known as a gymnasium pupil,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the zemstvo chief.  He was a man with a
bulging mouth and the same quick</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>running eyes; he shaved his moustache,
wore a dark beard with a string like the strap of a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>helmet, had curly hair, and dressed,
living in the country, in sportsman's</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>colored shirts trimmed over the belly
with a broad, chainpocketed belt,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>belt.   Cheprakov's peculiar, marvelous
quality was his ability</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to talk about anything with a single
word.  He was a guest at the estate</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for four days, looking after Evgenia
Alexeevna and collecting butterflies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Yes, indeed,” spoke Cheprakov,
”the ruff from the biological point of view, the ruff, so to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from the biological point of view, a
ruff, so to speak, free - one thing, a species, and cooked, as,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for example, now, - he picked the fish
with a spoon, - an object that requires onions and pepper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>pepper. Shchedrin wrote a fairy tale
about ruff, and well, quite witty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Pis-kar,” Pavel Pavlovich
stretched out anguishedly, ”pis-kar, and not</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>ruff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Ah, - Cheprakov was surprised, -
and I was ...  I used to catch peepers ... when ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>this...  last summer... Evgenia
Alekseevna,” he turned unexpectedly, ”you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>remind me of a fish swimming in the
water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Apollo,” sighed Inna Sergeyevna,
sucking a crust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>look, you have embarrassed Zhenya, ah,
you!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Gallant as a prince,” said Pavel
Pavlovich good-naturedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The girl laughed. The big,
frivolous Cheprakov made her laugh more,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>than angered her, with his unexpected
verbal shots.  He met her, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>strangely: shaking hands, he suddenly
said, “There are meetings and meetings. This is to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>me very pleasant, I am astonished,” and,
with a shake of his head, strutted away. He spoke</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>loudly, as if he were reading from a
book, not only to a deaf person, but to a deafish one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Apollon Semyonitch,” said
Eugenia, ”I have heard that you have been dangerously</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>dangerously ill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Yes. Bursa mucosa. - Cheprakov
looked tenderly at the girl and repeated with an</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>emphasis: - Mukoza. I bowed my head
under the blow of fate, but recovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     This topic was enough for him for a
long time.  He detailed the doctors who had treated him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the doctors who had treated him, the
medicines, the prescriptions, he remembered Sister of Mercy Pudikova,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>he got up from the table and continued
to describe the hospital regime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Usually after dinner, if the
weather was fine, Eugenia went into the woods,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>which began behind the pond; and her
uncle, covering his face with a handkerchief, lay down, saying from</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“Carmen”: “That no flies may disturb
us,” and fell asleep in the study; Inna</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Sergeevna had a long conversation in the
kitchen with the cook about unknown things, and then she would</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>went to her room, where she fiddled at
the mirror or took apart old lace, always</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>always trying to make something out of
it.  Cheprakov, taking a butterfly net,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>pins, and a vial of ether, stood on the
porch, waiting for the girl, and, when she</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>came out, he said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I'll go with you, it's necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Please. - Eugenia looked,
smiling, into his solemn face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>- Necessary?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Yes. You are a weak woman, -
Cheprakov said condescendingly, - that is why</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I have decided to guard you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Unfortunately, you are unarmed,
and I, as you said, - weak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - That's all right. - Cheprakov
bent his arm. - Here, feel the biceps muscle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I can bench press two poods.  I have a
folding gym at home.  Why don't you want</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>feel it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I believe it. Come on, let's go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     They passed the house, the pond,
and, crossing the edge of the forest, followed the path to the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the local landmark, the Horsehead Stone,
which looked more like a fathom rutabaga.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>like a fathom rutabaga.  Cheprakov,
trying to catch a dragonfly, an airplane walking through the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>through the air, tore the net.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - 'It is astonishing,' he said,
'from trifling causes such a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>- Well, I'll sew you up,” Eugenia
promised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - You, with your hands? - Cheprakov
asked sweetly. - This is happiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Come on, - said the girl, - go
still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - No, why not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - The same reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     “Really, I am beginning to speak
his language,” thought the girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Cheprakov's talkativeness paralyzed her;
she noticed with displeasure that she was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>sometimes unconsciously imitated him in
the turn of phrase.   His manner of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>manner of speaking was like an endless,
annoying tossing of breadsticks in his face</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>balls in his face.  “Is he always and
with everybody like that?  - Eugenia pondered. - Or</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>draws? I do not understand.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The smell of pine needles, ants and
humus was sharp.  The red trunks of pines, slightly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>creaking, swayed their tops. Cheprakov
saw a tit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Here is a bird,” he said, ”it is,
of course, beaten up, that a bird, but nevertheless a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>nevertheless a touching phenomenon.  -
He glanced at the thin blouse of his</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>companion's thin blouse, which clung
tightly round her round shoulders, and felt sharply a whiff of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of female youth.   His thoughts suddenly
became confused, losing their intrusive</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and jumped about uncertainly.  He fell
silent, rolling his eyes,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and noted the fuzz on the back of his
neck, the thin hand at the wrist, the mole at the corner of his lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“A pleasant, by God, maiden,” he
thought, “and yet perhaps still forbidden,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - And I'm going to town to-morrow,”
he said; ”a mass of business, various engagements, and various</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>relations; four days well spent here
have brought me,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>actually, physically and spiritually,
and I am as fresh as a young</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Dionysus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Do you love your work? - Eugenia
asked, biting her lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Of course I do!  No, however, -
corrected Cheprakov. - I am nothing but</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>an anarchist at heart. I like everything
grandiose, passionate. Men are pigs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - They're grossly material.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - But you get a salary, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - It is an honorary payment, a
fee,” explained Cheprakov gravely. He touched</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>his fingers on Evgenia's elbow, saying:
“A twig has stuck to you,” though this twig had been</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I came up with it after a long thought. 
- Now here's the thing,” he said gravely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>he spoke seriously, unconsciously
getting into the right tone, “what to say about me, I am a man of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a small man, doing what fate has given
me to do.  You, how do you live? What</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>what do you think, what do you dream
of?  What have you planned for your life?  That's what's more interesting to
know,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Evgenia Alekseyevna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - It is not said at once, - said
the girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Well, and yet? Well, how?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Cheprakov himself did not know why
he needed it;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>probably he changed his tone by
unconsciously observing that people who are</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>shy people often say to strangers what
they would not always say to people more</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>intimates, and why he needed it he did
not know definitively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     They approached the stone.  “What
shall I say?”  - Eugenia thought.  She did not</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>knew what Cheprakov imagined her to be,
but she felt that she was not what</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>she really was. In this, as well as in
the peculiar mood arising from the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from the fact that sometimes a chance
question brings together in the soul of a man his scattered</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>cherished things into one whole, - there
was a certain amount of desire to tell about herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Besides, for some reason she felt sorry
for Cheprakov, and it seemed to her that it would be possible to talk to him,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to talk to him at last without birds and
Dionysus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>- You see, Apollon Semyonitch,” she
began hesitatingly, sitting down on the grass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>on the grass; Cheprakov, with his chin
up, stood by the stone, “I have in my life two</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>demands. I want, first, to earn the love
and respect of people, and secondly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>- to be in some great, very necessary
and important business, and to be so closely associated</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>so that I and the people and the cause
are one. Do you understand? But I don't know</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I don't know how to express it.  But I
can't find it, or I'm not good at it, I don't know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>But it's hard, isn't it, to find
something that doesn't involve passions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and personal interests and ambition.  It
frightens me, I confess. Personal life should not</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>should not be entangled with anything,
let it flow in a different direction. Then I</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>would live, as they say, a full life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - N-yes, - Cheprakov stretched out,
sitting down next to me, - not many, not many</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>can do that.  I deeply respect you.  And
what do you say about the main thing, - the main enzyme of life?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of life? The sweet, the sweet, the
sweet. in a word, love?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - 'Well, yes,' Eugenia dropped
quickly, 'of course...' - She became embarrassed and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>flared up, then, as if justifying
herself, and already angry with herself for it,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>she added: - 'After all, everyone is
equal here, and men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Of course they are! - Cheprakov
said cheerfully. - Very much so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The girl laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     “And I, by God, I'll try,” thought
Cheprakov, “young ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>nineteen years old...  does not know
life...  - Then he continued to ponder, out of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>habit, as he said, in chopped phrases:
“How interesting is the awakening of love in the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>in a woman's heart.  Down with the
slogans of General Kuropatkin.  My dear, you're not indifferent</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to me. I'm coming to you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - 'Evgenia Alekseevna,' blurted out
Cheprakov, 'this is where the bursa mukosa was,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>а? Look at it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     He quickly rolled up his pants on
his left leg at the knee, exposing a hairy calf</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and a white scar. Eugenia, suddenly
cooled down, looked at Cheprakov in surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - What is the matter with you? -
She asked, standing up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - This is a mucosa.  - Cheprakov
tightened his pants. - What white skin ... and you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>too... hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Eugenia looked at her own hand and
saw that this hand</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>had found itself in Cheprakov's hand,
and he kissed it and pressed it against the left side of her breast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Well, leave it, - calmly, but
changed in face, said Eugenia. -</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Hands away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - No - why not? - Cheprakov said
naively. - It is sudden, deep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The girl picked up the umbrella,
turned and leisurely walked away. Cheprakov stood</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for some time longer on the spot,
stiffly looking after her, then he yawned falsely,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>walked down another path to the manor
house, took a fishing rod, and sat on the river until dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     At the table he avoided looking at
Eugenia, and she at him; this the aunt noted to herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the aunt remarked.  The next day in the
morning Cheprakov left for the city, having time to whisper a farewell to the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>whispered good-bye to the silent girl:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I experienced subtle, charming
moments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>IV</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>  Eugenia held the letter in her hands,
perplexedly examining the schoolboy's</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>half-masculine handwriting.  At last,
having given up hope of guessing from whom the letter was from,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>for she had no acquaintance in the
county town, and the postmark on the envelope</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>read: “Saburov,” the girl began to read.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - What, what is it?  - she cried
out in astonishment and resentment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Holding the letter with a trembling
hand, she bent down to it, bewildered at the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>surprise,-so much of deliberate malice,
venom, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>mockery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>                          “Gracious
sovereign,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>                        Mistress Evgenia
Alexeevna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     I do not know whether it is proper
for a young girl of noble birth (good for the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>noble ones) to go about with a married
man.  I suppose they teach you that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Tell me how you're not ashamed.  If you
behave like that, then your parents were good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>your parents.  Apollosha told me
everything.  It's not very nice of you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>on your part, young lady. Though we're
not married, we've been living together for four years, thank God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>And I won't let you take my man away
from me.  If you're in love with him, I advise you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>forget it, and take your tail somewhere
else.  If you're so intelligent, you won't be able</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>you won't catch anyone, you'd better
keep it to yourself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>                                                          
Ready for service</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>                                                           
Maria Tikhonova.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Having read to the end, Evgenia
Alexeevna dropped her hands and looked around helplessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>looked around.  A sickly, nervous
laughter was choking her. She did not even at once realize</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from whom the letter was from.  Separate
phrases, and the most offensive ones, one after another</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>one after another appeared before her in
the air as on a screen, overwhelming her with their</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>impressiveness; it was like a dream, in
which, wishing to flee from a frightful apparition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to flee from a frightful apparition, but
could not move. She even wondered</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>if it were a hoax of the same Cheprakov,
a crude, mad, but still a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>hoax; but it was difficult to think up
on purpose anything like such a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>letter.  The old fear of life seized the
girl; she guessed that the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>man is fatally defenceless in body and
soul; and even Siegfried, covered from head to foot with a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>head to foot covered with a horny skin,
had a spot on his back, the size of a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the size of a tree-leaf that had missed
death.  The whole sad and funny scene of the third</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>day, with the “bursa mukoza,” and the
kissing of hands, came to life before the girl; a burning color of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of shame flooded her from head to toe at
the thought that-it was most painful of all-her accidental frankness was known
to the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>her casual frankness was known to Maria
Tikhonova in a suspicious</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>transmission, acquiring a meaning
ludicrously shameful and likely to arouse a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>giggles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Eugenia was sitting upstairs alone, and
this helped her to recover from the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the insulting surprise.  Had this story
happened five years later, she</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>must have treated it, outwardly, a
little differently: either she would not have</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>answer the letter, or write a calm,
lucid reply.  But at</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>her present age she had not yet learned
to weigh the circumstances,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>continuing to regard people intimately
and in great detail, to the end.  The address of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Tikhonova was in the letter; the author
was apparently led by the well-known curiosity of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of challenge. Evgenia Alexeevna looked
at her watch: six o'clock. Wishing to stop personally</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and as soon as possible what she still
regarded as a misunderstanding, the girl, pinning on her</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>her hat and taking the letter, went
downstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     She had four versts to cover on
foot; there was no excuse to tell her to harness a horse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to tell them to harness the horse.  She
stepped out of the back porch into the village,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>turned around to see if any of the
household were following her, and walked rapidly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>toward the town, visible already from
the nearest hill by the red stain of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the red stain of the state wine warehouse,
the white belfries and gardens. The excitement did not leave</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>on the contrary: the nearer she came to
the dark fences of Saburov the more</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>more intolerable seemed the slowly
shrinking distance.  The girl was firmly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>sure that she would force herself to
listen, and that she would be given all the explanations she needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     At last she entered the town. 
Eugenia had been here before.  Stepping along the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>unsteady boards of the sidewalks,
thickly covered with nettles with their sharp, deafening</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>odor, the girl remembered one evening,
when, returning from a concert</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a visiting pianist's concert to the
hotel where Pavel Pavlych was waiting for her to leave together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Pavel Pavlych, walked leisurely through
the streets.  The town was falling asleep.  The red and purple curtains</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>red and purple curtains; on the high
dovecote the pigeons were sleepily cooing; on the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>square, by the sweatbox, the Slobodsk
burghers were finishing their last game of ryuhi;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>an old beggar, standing in the darkness
on the corner, was waving his hands, muttering inebriatedly;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from the open windows of the military
chief's apartment came the poorly learned</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“The Virgin's Prayer”; the men, sitting
on the nightstands at the inn, gabbled about the rented</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>meadows. The ravines smelled of the dampness
of the icy keys. The clear gleam of the stars glowed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>over the black roofs.  At the wharf,
throwing the murky light of the lanterns into the flour heaps,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>stood the steamer “Ivan Luppov”; its
mast lights against the black, like spilled</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>shoals of the opposite shore seemed an
illumination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     She remembered that peaceful
silence, marveling at the deceptiveness of the silence, its</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>undercurrents of sting; she was even
embarrassed to go with her indignation among the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>small, tidy, verdant houses, the shambling,
flimsy shacks, the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>rustic dust, harmless yellow paint, and
dormant mezzanines.  Having located</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>house and street, Eugenia, with a heavy
nervous oppression that filled her with sudden</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>fatigue, rang at the yellow front door.
She was opened by a dejected pregnant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Is Mrs. Tikhonova at home?  -
Eugenia asked, and suddenly she wanted to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to go away, but she overcame her fear. 
The woman stared at her with her mouth open; it was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>was ridiculous and heavy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - 'And I'm just now ... they are at
home,” said the woman, hiding in the hay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     At the window, at the side, a face
flattened with its nose against the glass, with an expression of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of greedy curiosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>  - “They're asking for you,” said the
dreary woman, returning after a languidly long minute,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the dreary woman.  She opened the door
wide, and stared at Eugenia, as if to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>guarding her with her gaze.  The girl,
taking a deep breath, entered the low room with the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>canaries, ivy, and Viennese chairs.  At
the far door, crossed on</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>arms crossed on her high bosom, a
blackbrowed, rosyfaced lady in a gray bonnet stood at the far door</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>lady in a gray hood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Whom do I have the honor? -
filtered the lady, examining Evgenia Alexeevna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The girl spoke with difficulty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - 'I am Mazalevskaya,' she said,
clenching her fingers to restrain the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>excitement, - I want to ask you why you,
without giving yourself the trouble to Here is your</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>letter.  - She held out the sheet to the
proudly smiling Tikhonova.  - Please,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>explain everything to me, do you hear?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - And what does labor have to do
with it?  - the lady spoke loudly, moving her eyebrows suggestively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>eyebrows.  - I have nothing to explain
to you. And I have nothing to talk to you about. Why</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Apollo is a pig in front of me, I know
that too.  And if, believe me,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a man says: “Ah, ah, ah, ah! She's
inclined to me,” -</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to entice a man with all sorts of
things, then, pardon me, no; ah,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>leave it.  I am not a girl to be led by
the nose. And I'm most surprised</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>that you even came; it's so modern,
please.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The girl's legs trembled, and she
looked at Tikhonova with the eyes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of a stricken man, and was confused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Well, listen,” she said, panting,
”this is senseless,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>don't you understand? </span>Я<span
lang=EN-US>...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Where is there to understand, -
said the lady, - we - county.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Eugenia did not finish, turned,
went out into the street and burst into tears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Trying to restrain herself, she hastily
pressed her handkerchief to her mouth and eyes;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>she walked and stopped by machine; the
rare passersby, turning round,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>looked at her for a long time, and then
turned their gaze to the fences, trees, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>roofs, as if that was where the
explanation was hidden; one said, shouting:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“What's screwed up, hearty?” Having
overcome her spasms, the girl saw Cheprakov; he was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>crossing the street on his way to
Tikhonova's apartment.  Not at all surprised</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>that she had met this man by chance, but
rather with a feeling of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of relief, Evgenia Alekseevna stopped
him at the corner.  Cheprakov, having ceased</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>waving his cane, took off his cap,
slumped back, and blinked so anxiously that</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>one could not doubt that he knew about
the letter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Cheprakov, giving himself away,
remained silent, not saying hello, not even pretending to be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>surprised to see Mazalevskaya in town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Do you know about the letter? -
The girl asked sternly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Cheprakov, arching his back, spread
his hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - </span>Я<span lang=EN-US>... </span>я<span
lang=EN-US>... </span>я<span lang=EN-US>... - he got confused. - I wanted to
shame her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Evgenia Alexeevna looked intently
into his hidden eyes,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>waved her hand and went out of town with
the slow gait of a tired man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>V</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>  Before going out to tea, Eugenia
washed her face thoroughly with cold water and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>went to the mirror.  The traces of her
recent disorder had disappeared.  Combing her hair,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>wrapping herself in fluffy, below the
knees, hair, the girl for the hundred and first time</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>relived the incident, indelible at her
age, but quieter and quieter, closer and closer to a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to a quiet sadness.  She was no longer
indignant, but perplexed.  In her life,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>in her shadowy life, there had been
occasions like these before, but she had not</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>formed a habit of them; she experienced
them each time with all her nerves;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>something like a fear of people had
developed in her gradually and imperceptibly. She</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>even now caught the sudden awakening of
this feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - What is there to be afraid of?  -
Eugenia Alexeyevna said aloud, trying to understand</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>herself.  Memories figuratively showed
her that it was terribly undeserved to be frightened by the evil</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>attitude of people, gloating and
unconscious cruelty, from which no one is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>from which no one is safe.  She remembered
several instances of this toward herself and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>others...  Evgenia Alexeevna saw herself
especially clearly in the streets of St. Petersburg</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and in the Crimea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     In the street, on approaching the
girl, a man of imposing and staid</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>posture, stopped, struck her very hard
with his fist in the breast, and calmly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>passed without even turning around.  And
in the Crimea, at the boardinghouse table, during the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>dinner, a wellfed dapper merchant, still
a young man, resplendent with rings</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and diamonds, seeing very well that his
words were unpleasant and outrageous,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>spoke calmly of his thefts during the
Japanese war, addressing himself to his</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>his mistress and his guide friend. Once
in a while he addressed the others as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Do you ask me to stop?  Come on! 
You've been donating to the wounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>money in my pocket. Forty thousand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Yevgenia Alexeyevna went downstairs
and drank strong tea.  The usual, almost</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>unmeaning conversation with her
relatives, she carried on machine-like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - 'Zheniechka,' said Inna Sergeyevna
at the end, as if by accident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>the day before yesterday Apollo... it
seemed to me. you didn't quarrel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Not at all. - She looked calmly
at her aunt and smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     It was already dusk, when, wishing
to be alone, Eugenia went around the pond full of clouds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>cloudy pond.  She walked along the edge
of the forest, the dusky fields opening out to the left, under the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>lost the luster of the sleepy blue of
the sky, the birds chimed muffled in the woods, the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a lowered veil of semi-darkness
concealed its low daylight.  At the hedge</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a corncrake twitched.   Eugenia stopped;
the desolate silence of the neighborhood</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>pleased her; she stood thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Go to bed,” said a voice behind
her, ”though you are a woodpecker and a working bird,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>yet take care of your strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>Mazalevskaya flinched and turned toward
the unseen speaker.  He was not</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>He was not visible, he was sitting or
lying in the dark bushes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     A woodpecker, without ceasing, was
chiseling the tree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Uncooperative,” continued the
voice, ”at least you have learned my language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>A-m-m-me-me-ma-am, a-am, me-e.
Crestfallen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The voice fell silent, and out of
the bushes came a man with a bag over his shoulders, wearing an old</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>cartouche, boots, and a beak, such as is
used by devotees; he wanted to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>to leap over the hedge, but, noticing
Eugenia, threw off his cartouche and held out his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - A-m-m-m-me-me-ma-am-me-e,” he
mumbled, pointing to his mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Mute? - Eugenia asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The man nodded, expressively
looking at the young lady's hand and purse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Though you are a working bird, -
said Eugenia unexpectedly to herself,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>holding out the change, “but take care
of your strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Overheard,” suddenly said the
supposed mute quite distinctly, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and grinned confusedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - What do you need it for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I have a need,” said the man
evasively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - You are not afraid of me,” said
Eugenia, thinking. Her curiosity was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>deeply hurt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     The man looked around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - So what, you are not interested,
- he reluctantly spoke. - Just</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a runaway soldier. Not a big bird. You
see, I have a passport, I bought it somewhere, but..,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I'm sorry, I can't lie. At night, you
know, or on the border,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>a man will give you a drink, - they like
to talk, they're interested in passers-by.  Well, you see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and especially at a lodging.  It's
dangerous.  I ran away from one railroad</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I ran away from a railroad guard; the
old man was after me, you see, and what's in it for him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>and what's in it for him?  Of course,
after thinking about it, I pretended to be mute, and so I'm going. To Odessa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I have acquaintances there; they'll
arrange it for me.  In a month, believe me, I haven't said a dozen words to
people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I've never spoken a dozen words with
people, except sometimes to talk to myself out of boredom; and here you are,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>I see you will do no harm,” he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - I won't,” confirmed Eugenia
absent-mindedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - That's so. Thank you for the
trifle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     Sotkin jumped over the hedge, waved
his cartouche, and walked, shaking the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>shaking his bag towards the village.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     - Well, thank God,” said Eugenia,
coming up to the porch of the manor house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>“now I think I know something too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>     She thought that one must live like
this soldier, that the man who hid himself from others was greater and deeper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>that a man who hid himself from others
would penetrate more and more deeply into the life of others like himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>in the complex confusion of the human
soul.  This was still fermenting in her</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>vaguely, but imperiously. She was
beginning to realize that in the great pain and drudgery of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>of life, it is a rare man is more
interested in another man's “cherished” than in his own, and so</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>would remain so until the “cherished”
became common to all, for now it was for</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>is still a reproach and suffering for
many. And the people to whom it is close even now,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-US>in their light essence, can only be
guessed, felt and overheard.</span></p>
